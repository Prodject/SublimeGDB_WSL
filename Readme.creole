=== Description ===
GDB plugin for Sublime Text 3, running on windows 10 WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) - bash.
(python 3).

Please observe that this is a fork from the original SublimeGDB (https://github.com/quarnster/SublimeGDB).
So far, I`ve tested only with my project. Feel free to try.

=== Installation ===
Usually just git clone this repo to your "c:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 3\Packages\"

I used my SublimeGDB.sublime-settings like this:
{
  "workingdir": "C:\\<more path...>\\<path to the executable>",
  "commandline": "bash -c \"gdb --interpreter=mi .\/<executable>\"",
  "windows_bash_compatibility": true,
  "gdb_timeout": 3,
}


=== Usage ===

In short:
* Open up the default settings via the command palette and begin typing GDB and select the default.
* See what options are available, and open up the User SublimeGDB preferences to tweak any values
* If you have multiple projects, you most likely want to put project specific setting in your project file, with a prefixed "sublimegdb_". See the comments at the top of the default SublimeGDB preferences for an example.
* If you have multiple executables in the same project, you can add a "sublimegdb_executables" setting to your project settings, and add an entry for each executable's settings.
* Once you're all configured, you can toggle breakpoints with F9 (OSX Users might want to change the key binding, or disable the "Expos√© and Spaces" key bindings in the System Preferences)
* Launch with F5
* Step over with F10
* Step into with F11
* Step out with Shift+F11
* Click on the appropriate line in the GDB Callstack view to go to that stack frame
* Click a variable in the GDB Variables view to show its children (if available)
* Double click a variable in the GDB Variables view to modify its value
* You can also access some commands by right clicking in any view
